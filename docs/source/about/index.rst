``osipi`` is developed by the Open Source Initiative for Perfusion Imaging `OSIPI <www.osipi.org>`_, an initiative of the perfusion study group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine `ISMRM <www.ismrm.org>`_. 

The ``osipi`` package structure and logic follows the `lexicon <https://osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/>`_ defined by OSIPI, and wraps around selected implementations collected in the `code contributions <https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection>`_ of OSIPI.
